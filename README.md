# Learnings taken

- Generation needs a lot of planning.
  - Do not rely on physics engine for generation.
- Really rely on either FMOD or Unity Sound, try not to mix them.
- First work experience with Perforce.
- Generation is very intensive and should either be hidden behind loading or very quickly very fast very parallel.
